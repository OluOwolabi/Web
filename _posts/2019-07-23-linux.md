# **What is Linux**
Linux is an operating system created by Linus Torvalds. It's a free and open-source that powers about 0% of the servers. There are several distribution of the Linux OS as there are different distribution of the Windows OS, some distributions are;
- Ubuntu (Kinda the popular one)
- Debian
- Fedora
- Kali Linux (Used by Cyber-Security analyst mostly for Penetration Testing)

These different distros are all Linux distribution, just that it's has been modified by adding more applications and performance to execute specific functions. When a computer is not running a windows OS, there's a 80% probability it is running one of the Linux distribution. Also, with the help of Virtual Machine (Virtualization), a computer running windows OS can still run any Linux distro.

# **The Linux Shell or Terminal**
The terminal is an Command Line Interface (CLI) that receives commands as user input and pass it on to the OS for processing. All distros of the Linux OS comes as a Graphical User Interface (GUI). In this tutorial, we will be discussing some basic/popular/useful shell commands and their functions. Below is what Linux CLI look like.
